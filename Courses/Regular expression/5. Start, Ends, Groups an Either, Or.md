Sometimes it's very useful to specify that we want to search by a certain pattern **in the beginning or the end of a line**. We do that with these characters:  
`^` - starts with  
`$` - ends with

So for example, if you want to search for a line that **starts with** `abc`, you can use `^abc`.  
If you want to search for a line that **ends with** `xyz`, you can use `xyz$`.

Note: The `^` hat symbol is used to exclude a charset when enclosed in `[`square brackets`]`, but when it is not, it is used to specify the beginning of a word.

You can also define groups by enclosing a pattern in `(`parentheses`)`. This function can be used for many ways that are not in the scope of this tutorial. We will use it to define an **either/ or** pattern, and also to repeat patterns. To say "or" in Regex, we use the `|` pipe.

For an "either/or" pattern example, the pattern `during the (day|night)` will match both of these sentences: `during the day` and `during the night`.  
For a repetition example, the pattern `(no){5}` will match the sentence `nonononono`.
