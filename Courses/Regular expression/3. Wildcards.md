The wildcard that is used to match any single character (except the line break) is the `.` dot. That means that `a.c` will match `aac`, `abc`, `a0c`, `a!c`, and so on.

Also, you can set a character as optional in your pattern using the `?` question mark. That means that `abc?` will match `ab` and `abc`, since the `c` is optional.

Note: If you want to search for `.` a literal dot, you have to **escape it** with a `\` reverse slash. That means that `a.c` will match `a.c`, but also `abc`, `a@c`, and so on. But `a\.c` will match **just** `a.c`.
