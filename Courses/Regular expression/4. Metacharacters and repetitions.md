There are easier ways to match bigger charsets.

- `\d` matches a digit, like `9`  
- `\D` matches a non-digit, like `A` or `@` 
- `\w` matches an alphanumeric character, like `a` or `3`  
- `\W` matches a non-alphanumeric character, like `!` or `#`  
- `\s` matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks)  
- `\S` matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols)

Note: Underscores `_` are included in the `\w` metacharacter and not in `\W`. That means that `\w` will match every single character in `test_file`.

Here's a reference for each repetition along with how many times it matches the preceding pattern:
- `{12}` - **exactly 12** times.  
- `{1,5}` - **1 to 5** times.  
- `{2,}` - **2 or more** times.  
- `*` - **0 or more** times.  
- `+` - **1 or more** times.
