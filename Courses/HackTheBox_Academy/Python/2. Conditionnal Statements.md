# Conditional Statements and Loops
#### If-Elif-Else Statement
```python
happy = 2

if happy == 1:
    print("Happy and we know it!")
elif happy == 2:
    print("Excited about it!")
else:
    print("Not happy...")
```
#### The While-Loop
```python
counter = 0

while counter < 5:
    print(f'Hello #{counter}')
    counter = counter + 1
```

# Loops and Lists
#### The For-Each Loop
```python
groceries = ['Walnuts', 'Grapes', 'Bird seeds']

for food in groceries:
    print(f'I bought some {food} today.')
```
#### Format Strings
```python
equation = f'The meaning of life might be {6 * 7}.'  # -> The meaning of life might be 42.

me = 'Birb'
greeting = f'Hello {me}!'  # -> Hello Birb!
```
#### A List of Strings
```python
groceries = ['Walnuts', 'Grapes', 'Bird seeds']
# index:         0          1          2
```
#### Strings Indexing

#### Substrings
```python
>>> var = "ABCDEF"
>>> print(var[:2])	# Up to index 2
AB
>>> print(var[2:])	# Ignore everything up to index 2
CDEF
>>> print(var[2:4])	# Everything between index 2 and 4 ("2" is counted)
CD
>>> print(var[-2:])	# Up to negative index 2 (last two characters)
