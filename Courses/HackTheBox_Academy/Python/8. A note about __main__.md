# A note about the `__main__` function
Python scripts are executed from top to bottom, even when imported
if somebody were to import our script, the code would run as soon as imported
To avoid this, we can use the `__main__` function
The critical takeaway is that the code inside this conditional statement only gets executed when the script is `run`, not `imported`

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(url)
```
