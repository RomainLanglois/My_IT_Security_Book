# Syscalls
A `syscall` is like a globally available function written in `C`, provided by the Operating System Kernel. A syscall takes the required arguments in the registers and executes the function with the provided arguments.

it depends on the Linux distribution, but syscall can be found aroud this directory :
- /usr/include

For example, on Fedora, a list of syscall can be found here :
- For x86
	- /usr/include/asm/unistd_32.h
- For x64
	- /usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h

However, this amazing website give us a complete list of all syscalls for the most common platform :

## Syscall Calling Convention
Now that we understand how to locate various syscall and their arguments let's start learning how to call them. To call a syscall, we have to:
1.  Save registers to stack
2.  Set its syscall number in `rax`
3.  Set its arguments in the registers
4.  Use the syscall assembly instruction to call it

## Exemple with "write" and "exit" (x64)
This will simply print hello world :
```nasm
global  _start

section .data
    msg db 'Hello world !', 0xa    		; String to be printed
    len equ $ - msg                     ; Length of the string

section .text
_start:
	; Initiliaze variables
    xor rax, rax                        ; Initialize rax to 0
    xor rbx, rbx                        ; Initialize rbx to 0
	
    ; This will initialize and execute the write systemcall
    mov rax, 0x01                       ; Systemcall Number
    mov rdi, 0x01                       ; 1 = Stdout
    lea rsi, [msg]                      ; rsi = Hello world
    mov rdx, len                        ; Length of the string
    syscall                             ; Calling the syscall
	
    ; This will initialize and call the exit systemcall
    mov rax, 0x3C						; Systemcall Number
    mov rdi, 0x0						; 0, to say the problem ends without problems
    syscall
```
