# Conditionnal Branching
`Conditional Branching` instructions are only processed when a specific condition is met.
A conditional jump instruction has multiple varieties as `Jcc`, where `cc` represents the Condition Code.

# RFLAGS Register
We have been talking about meeting certain conditions, but we have not yet discussed how these conditions are met or where they are stored. This is where we use the `RFLAGS` register.
The `RFLAGS` register consists of 64-bits like any other register. However, this register does not hold values but holds flag bits instead. Each bit 'or set of bits' turns to `1` or `0` depending on the value of the last instruction.
- `Arithmetic instructions set the necessary 'RFLAG' bits depending on their outcome.`

Just like other registers, the 64-bit `RFLAGS` register has a 32-bit sub-register called `EFLAGS`, and a 16-bit sub-register called `FLAGS`, which holds the most significant flags we may encounter.  
The flags we would mostly be interested in are :
-   The Carry Flag `CF`: Indicates whether we have a float.
-   The Parity Flag `PF`: Indicates whether a number is odd or even.
-   The Zero Flag `ZF`: Indicates whether a number is zero.
-   The Sign Flag `SF`: Indicates whether a register is negative.

# CMP
The Compare instruction `cmp` simply compares the two operands, by subtracting the second operand from first operand (i.e. `D1` - `S2`), and then sets the necessary flags in the `RFLAGS` register. For example, if we use `cmp rbx, 10`, then the compare instruction would do '`rbx - 10`', and set the flags based on the result.
