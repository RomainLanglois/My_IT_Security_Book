# Arithmetic Instructions
## Unary Instructions
The following are the main Unary Arithmetic Instructions (we will assume that `rax` starts as `1` for each instruction) :

## Binary Instructions
Next, we have Binary Arithmetic Instructions, and the main ones are: We'll assume that both `rax` and `rbx` start as `1` for each instruction.

## Bitwise Instructions
Now, let's move to Bitwise Instructions, which are instructions that work on the bit level (we'll assume that `rax = 1` and `rbx = 2` for each instruction) :
