# Functions
## Functions Calling Convention

Functions are a form of `procedures`. However, functions tend to be more complex and should be expected to use the stack and all registers fully. So, we can't simply call a function as we did with procedures. Instead, functions have a `Calling Convention` to properly set up before being called.

There are four main things we need to consider before calling a function :
1.  `Save Registers` on the stack (`Caller Saved`)
2.  Pass `Function Arguments` (like syscalls)
3.  Fix `Stack Alignment`
4.  Get Function's `Return Value` (in `rax`)

#### Writing Functions
All of the above points are from a `caller` point of view, as we call a function. When it comes to writing a function, there are different points to consider, which are:
1.  Saving `Callee Saved` registers (`rbx` and `rbp`)
2.  Get arguments from registers
3.  Align the Stack
4.  Return value in `rax`
