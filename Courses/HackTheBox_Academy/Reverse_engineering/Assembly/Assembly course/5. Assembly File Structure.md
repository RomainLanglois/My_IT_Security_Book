# Assembly File Structure

## General overview

## Sections of an assembly file

## Directives
An Assembly code is line-based, which means that the file is processed line-by-line, executing the instruction of each line. We see at the first line a directive `global _start`, which instructs the machine to start processing the instructions after the `_start` label.

## Variables

## Code
The second (and most important) section is the `.text` section. This section holds all of the assembly instructions and loads them to the `text` memory segment. Once all instructions are loaded into the `text` segment, the processor starts executing them one after another.
