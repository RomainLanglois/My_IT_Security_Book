# How to use the stack
The stack is a segment of memory allocated for the program to store data in, and it is usually used to store data and then retrieve them back temporarily. The top of the stack is referred to by the Top Stack Pointer `rsp`, while the bottom is referred to by the Base Stack Pointer `rbp`.

The stack has a `Last-in First-out` (`LIFO`) design, which means we can only `pop` out the last element `push`ed into the stack.

## Usage With Functions/Syscalls
We will primarily be pushing data from registers into the stack before we call a `function` or call a `syscall`, and then restore them after the function and the syscall. This is because `functions` and `syscalls` usually use the registers for their processing, and so if the values stored in the registers will get changed after a function call or a syscall, we will lose them.
