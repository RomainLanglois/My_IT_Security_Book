# Control Instructions
Types of `Control Instructions` include :
- Loops
- Branching
- Function Calls

Such instructions allow us to change the flow of the program and direct it to another line.

## Loop Structure 
Let's start by discussing `Loops`. A loop in assembly is a set of instructions that repeat for `rcx` times.

## Unconditional Branching
The basic `jmp` instruction is unconditional, which means that it will always jump to the specified location, regardless of the conditions. This contrasts with `Conditional Branching` instructions that only jump if a specific condition is met.
the unconditional `jmp` instruction, which keeps jumping back to `loopFib` forever since a specific condition does not restrict it. This is similar to a `(while true)` loop.

This is why unconditional Branching is usually used in cases where need always to jump, and it is not suitable for loops, as it will loop forever. To stop jumping when a specific condition is met, we will use `Conditional Branching`.
