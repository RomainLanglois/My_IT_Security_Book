# Registers, Addresses and Data Types
## 1) General concepts
The registers are the fastest components in any computer, as they are built within the CPU core. However, registers are very limited in size and can only hold a few bytes of data at a time.

There are two main types of registers we will be focusing on: `Data Registers` and `Pointer Registers`

-   `Data Registers` - are usually used for storing instructions/syscall arguments. The primary data registers are: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, and `rdx`. The `rdi` and `rsi` registers also exist and are usually used for the instruction `destination` and `source` operands. Then, we have secondary data registers that can be used when all previous registers are in use, which are `r8`, `r9`, and `r10`.
    
-   `Pointer Registers` - are used to store specific important address pointers. The main pointer registers are the Base Stack Pointer `rbp`, which points to the beginning of the Stack, the Current Stack Pointer `rsp`, which points to the current location within the Stack (top of the Stack), and the Instruction Pointer `rip`, which holds the address of the next instruction.

The following are the names of the sub-registers for all of the essential registers in an x86_64 architecture :

## 3) Address Endianness 
There are two types of endianness : 
- `Little-Endian` : `right-to-left`
- `Big-Endian` : `left-to-right`
