# 1. PE file format - DOS Header (From 0x00 to 0x40)
## Overview
- The DOS header (also called the MS-DOS header) is a 64-byte-long structure that exists at the start of the PE file.  
- It’s not important for the functionality of PE files on modern Windows systems, however it’s there because of backward compatibility reasons.  
- This header makes the file an MS-DOS executable, so when it’s loaded on MS-DOS the DOS stub gets executed instead of the actual program.  
- Without this header, if you attempt to load the executable on MS-DOS it will not be loaded and will just produce a generic error.

## Structure
```C
typedef struct _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER {      // DOS .EXE header
    WORD   e_magic;                     // Magic number
    WORD   e_cblp;                      // Bytes on last page of file
    WORD   e_cp;                        // Pages in file
    WORD   e_crlc;                      // Relocations
    WORD   e_cparhdr;                   // Size of header in paragraphs
    WORD   e_minalloc;                  // Minimum extra paragraphs needed
    WORD   e_maxalloc;                  // Maximum extra paragraphs needed
    WORD   e_ss;                        // Initial (relative) SS value
    WORD   e_sp;                        // Initial SP value
    WORD   e_csum;                      // Checksum
    WORD   e_ip;                        // Initial IP value
    WORD   e_cs;                        // Initial (relative) CS value
    WORD   e_lfarlc;                    // File address of relocation table
    WORD   e_ovno;                      // Overlay number
    WORD   e_res[4];                    // Reserved words
    WORD   e_oemid;                     // OEM identifier (for e_oeminfo)
    WORD   e_oeminfo;                   // OEM information; e_oemid specific
    WORD   e_res2[10];                  // Reserved words
    LONG   e_lfanew;                    // File address of new exe header
  } IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, *PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER;
```

This structure is important to the PE loader on MS-DOS, however only a few members of it are important to the PE loader on Windows Systems.
-   **`e_magic`:** This is the first member of the DOS Header, it’s a WORD so it occupies 2 bytes, it’s usually called the magic number. It has a fixed value of `0x5A4D` or `MZ` in ASCII, and it serves as a signature that marks the file as an MS-DOS executable.
-   **`e_lfanew`:** This is the last member of the DOS header structure, it’s located at offset `0x3C` into the DOS header and it holds an offset to the start of the NT headers. This member is important to the PE loader on Windows systems because it tells the loader where to look for the file header.
