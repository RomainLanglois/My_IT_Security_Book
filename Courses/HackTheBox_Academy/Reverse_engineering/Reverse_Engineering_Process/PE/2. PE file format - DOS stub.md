# 2. PE file format - DOS stub (From 0x40 to 0x80)
## Overview
- The DOS stub is an MS-DOS program that prints an error message saying that the executable is not compatible with DOS then exits.  
- This is what gets executed when the program is loaded in MS-DOS, the default error message is “This program cannot be run in DOS mode.”, however this message can be changed by the user during compile time.

## Using IDA to decompile the DOS stub
MS-DOS programs are 16-bit programs, so I chose the `intel 8086` processor type and the 16-bit disassembly mode

## Two syscalls
#### The first one
These three lines are responsible for printing the error message, first line sets `dx` to the address of the string “This program cannot be run in DOS mode.” (`0xe`), second line sets `ah` to `9` and the last line invokes interrupt `21h`.
```asm
seg000:0002                 mov     dx, 0Eh
seg000:0005                 mov     ah, 9
seg000:0007                 int     21h             ; DOS - PRINT STRING
seg000:0007                                         ; DS:DX -> string terminated by "$"
```
#### The second one
The last three lines of the program are again an interrupt `21h` call, this time there’s a `mov` instruction that puts `0X4C01` into `ax`, this sets `al` to `0x01` and `ah` to `0x4c`.
```asm
seg000:0009                 mov     ax, 4C01h
seg000:000C                 int     21h             ; DOS - 2+ - QUIT WITH EXIT CODE (EXIT)
seg000:000C                                         ; AL = exit code
```
`0x4c` is the function code of the function that exits with an error code, it takes the error code from `al`, which in this case is `1`.
