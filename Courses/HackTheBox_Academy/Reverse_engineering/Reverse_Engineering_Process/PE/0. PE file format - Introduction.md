# 0. PE format - Introduction
PE stands for Portable Executable, it’s a file format for executables used in Windows operating systems, it’s based on the `COFF` file format (Common Object File Format).

Not only `.exe` files are PE files, dynamic link libraries (`.dll`), Kernel modules (`.srv`), Control panel applications (`.cpl`) and many others are also PE files.

A PE file is a data structure that holds information necessary for the OS loader to be able to load that executable into memory and execute it.
