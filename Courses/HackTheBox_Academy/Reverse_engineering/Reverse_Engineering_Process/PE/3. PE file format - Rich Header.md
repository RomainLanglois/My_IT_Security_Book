# 3. PE file format - Rich Header (From 0x80 to 0x100)
- There’s still a chunk of data we haven’t talked about lying between the DOS Stub and the start of the NT Headers.
- This chunk of data is commonly referred to as the Rich Header, it’s an undocumented structure that’s only present in executables built using the Microsoft Visual Studio toolset.
- The Rich Header is not actually a part of the PE file format structure and can be completely zeroed-out without interfering with the executable’s functionality, it’s just something that Microsoft adds to any executable built using their Visual Studio toolset.
- The Rich Header consists of a chunk of XORed data followed by a signature (`Rich`) and a 32-bit checksum value that is the XOR key.

#### Fun fact about the "Olympic Destroyer malware"
The authors of the malware overwrote the original Rich Header in the malware executable with the Rich Header of another malware attributed to the Lazarus threat group to make it look like it was Lazarus.
