ASN: An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is **a unique identifier assigned to a group of one or more IP prefixes run by one or more network operators that maintain a single, clearly defined routing policy**

The `BGP-Toolkit` hosted by [Hurricane Electric](https://bgp.he.net/) is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can. We can glean a lot from this info.
