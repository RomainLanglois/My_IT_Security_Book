DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like https://whois.domaintools.com/, and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. We can get back many records and other data ranging from DNS resolution to testing for DNSSEC and if the site is accessible in more restricted countries. Sometimes we may find additional hosts out of scope, but look interesting. In that case, we could bring this list to our client to see if any of them should indeed be included in the scope. We may also find interesting subdomains that were not listed in the scoping documents, but reside on in-scope IP addresses and therefore are fair game.
