Social media can be a treasure trove of interesting data that can clue us in to how the organization is structured, what kind of equipment they operate, potential software and security implementations, their schema, and more. On top of that list are job-related sites like LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Glassdoor. Simple job postings often reveal a lot about a company. For example, take a look at the job listing below. It's for a `SharePoint Administrator` and can key us in on many things. We can tell from the listing that the company has been using SharePoint for a while and has a mature program since they are talking about security programs, backup & disaster recovery, and more. What is interesting to us in this posting is that we can see the company likely uses SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. That means they may have upgraded in place, potentially leaving vulnerabilities in play that may not exist in newer versions. This also means we may run into different versions of SharePoint during our engagements.
