-   Are there paths to Domain Admin from ASRepRoastable users?
-   Does a machine with spooler service running have admin privileges over another computer without SMB signing?
-   Which computers are of interest? Exchange, unconstrained, SQL, ADFS, Azure AD Connect, DCs, etc.
-   Which computers should be scanned for EternalBlue?
-   Which users should I look for during session hunting?
-   Make a priority list for Kerberoast hash cracking
