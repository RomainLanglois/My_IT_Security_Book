# Overview
- Bloodhound use the Cypher Query Language to analyse relationships
- Bloodhound comes with various pre-build queries
	- Ex : The shortest path to Domain Admin / hosts with the most sessions, and domain trust mapping.
- Bloodhound supports custom queries
	- Ex : The following query can identify the shortest path from Kerberoasting to Domain Admins
```sql
MATCH (u:User {hasspn:true}) MATCH (g:Group) WHERE g.name = 'DOMAIN ADMINS@INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL' MATCH p = shortestPath( (u)-[*1..]->(g) ) RETURN p
```

# Graph theory
Edges can be directed and in `BloodHound` edges always go one way, towards further privileges/compromise.

# Example with bloodhound 
Let's says we have control of the user account (node A) `glen.young` and check to see if we have a path to achieve Domain Admin level access. `BloodHound` runs a `shortestPath` query and shows us that `glen.young` has the `ForceChangePassword` ACL edge privilege over the user `pamela.brown` (node b), who is a member of the group `Help Desk` (node c). Members of this group have the `GenericWrite` ACL edge privilege over the `Security Operations` group (node d) and add a user to this group. This group is nested into the `Domain Admins` (node e) group, which is shown with the `MemberOf` edge. Therefore, we are effectively granted the same rights as the Domain Admins group once in the Security Operations group.
