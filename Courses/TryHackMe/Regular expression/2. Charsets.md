A charset is defined by enclosing in `[` square brackets `]` the character(s), or range of characters that you want to match.Â  Then, it finds **every occurrence** of the pattern you have defined in the file/text you are searching.

`[abc]` will match `a`, `b`, and `c` (every occurrence of each letter)

`[abc]zz` will match `azz`, `bzz`, and `czz`.

You can also use a `-` dash to define ranges:  
`[a-c]zz` is the same as above.

And then you can combine ranges together:  
`[a-cx-z]zz` will match `azz`, `bzz`, `czz`, `xzz`, `yzz`, and `zzz`.

Most notably, this can be used to match any alphabetical character:  
`[a-zA-Z]` will match any **single** letter (lowercase or uppercase).

You can use numbers too:  
`file[1-3]` will match `file1`, `file2`, and `file3`.

Then, there is a way to **exclude** characters from a charset with the `^` hat symbol, and include everything else.  
`[^k]ing` will match `ring`, `sing`, `$ing`, but not `king`.

Of course, you can exclude charsets, not just single characters.  
`[^a-c]at` will match `fat` and `hat`, but not `bat` or `cat`.
