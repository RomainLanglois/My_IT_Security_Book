## Filtering Objects
When retrieving output objects, you may want to select objects that match a very specific value. You can do this using the `Where-Object` to filter based on the value of properties. 
The general format of the using this _cmdlet_ is 

`Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property PropertyName -operator Value`
`Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.PropertyName -operator Value}`

The second version uses the $\_ operator to iterate through every object passed to the Where-Object cmdlet.
**Powershell is quite sensitive so make sure you don't put quotes around the command!**

Where `-operator` is a list of the following operators:
-   -Contains: if any item in the property value is an exact match for the specified value
-   -EQ: if the property value is the same as the specified value
-   -GT: if the property value is greater than the specified value
Here's an example of checking the stopped processes:
