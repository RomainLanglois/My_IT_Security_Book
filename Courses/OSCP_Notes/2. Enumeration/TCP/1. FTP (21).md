# FTP Enumeration:
## Checks
-   Check if you have anonymous access    
-   Check for weak credentials
	-  ex :  admin - admin
	-  ex : guest - guest
	-  ex : guest - "no password"
-   Check if you can upload a file to trigger, for example, a webshell through the webapp
-   Check if you can download backup files to extract included passwords
-   Check the version of FTP for exploits

## FTP transfer mode
- https://www.jscape.com/blog/ftp-binary-and-ascii-transfer-types-and-the-case-of-corrupt-files

```bash
# This will pass the FTP transfer to ASCII mode
ftp> ascii
200 Type set to A
# This will pass the FTP transfer to BINARY mode
ftp> binary
200 Type set to I
ftp> 
```

#### ASCII mode (default)
- only for TXT files

#### BINARY mode
- Image files (e.g. .jpg, .bmp, .png)
- Sound files (e.g. .mp3, .avi, .wma)
- Video files (eg. .flv, .mkv, .mov, .mp4) 
- Archive files (e.g. .zip, .rar, .tar)
- Other files (e.g. .exe, .doc, .xls, .pdf, etc.)

## FTP Passive et Active mode
- Active Mode : The client issues a PORT command to the server signaling that it will “actively” provide an IP and port number to open the Data Connection back to the client.
- Passive Mode : The client issues a PASV command to indicate that it will wait “passively” for the server to supply an IP and port number, after which the client will create a Data Connection to the server.
