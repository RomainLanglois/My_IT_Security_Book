# WinRM Enumeration
To make it simple WinRM can be compared to a simple Shell - SSH service running on Linux boxes. But instead it a Powershell waiting for you.
On Windows boxes, you could find a WinRM service running on ports:
- HTTP : 5985
- HTTPS : 5986

Note : WinRM is activated by defaut on Windows servers
