# HTTP Enumeration
## Checks
-   Login portals
    -   try the default credentials of the application
    -   try usernames already seen throughout the application or in other services like SMTP
    -   try SQL injection bypass
    -   try to enumerate users through login page
    -   try registering a new user 
		-   last possibility, if this a known web application (code online) and the register page does not exists, try to create a new user using HTTP requests directly (ref. Bart HTB)
    -   brute force with hydra, medusa, ...    
-   If this is a hand made website try to guess what the developer did (PHP code)
-   Check robots.txt for hidden directories
-   If it's a HTTPS website look for information inside the certificate 
-   Brute force directories to find hidden content
	-   In last resort use a different wordlist (Example : SecList)
		-   /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt
-   Check for passwords/URLs/versions/... in the HTML code of web app
-   Check version numbers for known exploits
    -   Check changelog for version information
    -   Estimate version based on copyright date (if not automatically adjusted)
    -   Download a static web page and use exiftool to determine the date (to use in last resort)
		-   Use "wget" not firefox directly (Firefox will change the date)
-   Check if specific CMS is used like WordPress and then use platform specific scanners
-   ways to RCE
    -   check for file upload functionalities (if uploads are filtered, try alternative extensions)
    -   execute commands through SQLi
    -   Shellshock
    -   command injection  
    -   trigger injected code through LFI / RFI
    -   etc...

## Nikto
```bash
nikto -host http://10.10.10.10/ -output nikto_scan.txt
``` 

## Gobuster
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.115.144:7331/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
gobuster dir -f -u http://192.168.115.144:7331/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt #Be carefull with the "-f"
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.115.144:7331/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt -s 204,301
gobuster dir -t 70 -u http://192.168.115.144:7331/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt -s 204,301

# BruteForce VHOST
gobuster vhost -u http://<domain_name> -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt
```

## WFUZZ (To use for very specific web fuzzing)
```bash
# To use when fuzzing for a particular element like a PHP file parameter
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/common.txt --hc 404 http://192.168.115.133/index.php?FUZZ=

# This will enumerate the user on the remote web application
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -d "username=FUZZ&password=anything" --hs "<web_application_reject_phrase>"  http://10.10.10.10/login.php/

# This command will fuzz for hidden http headers using a particuler parameter.
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/common.txt http://192.168.115.133/index.php -H FUZZ:FUZ2Z -w <other_world_list>

# Vhost brute force
# HTTP website
wfuzz -t 20 --hc 403,404 -H "Host: FUZZ.mango.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt http://10.10.10.162
# HTTPS website
wfuzz -t 20 --hc 403,404 -H "Host: FUZZ.mango.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt https://10.10.10.162
```

## Login Portals
```bash
# Basic auth
hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -f $ip http-get /path

# Login form
# Try to use wordlists from the SecList github repository (rockyou.txt is simply too big)
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt $ip http-post-form "<directory>:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&<rest of post request>:<error message>"

# Example :
hydra -l admin -P /opt/SecLists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt swagshop.htb http-post-form "/index.php/admin:form_key=0KCqeZv672fV6SXS&login[username]=admin&dummy=&login[password]=^PASS^:Invalid User Name or Password"
