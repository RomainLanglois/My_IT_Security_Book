# WebDAV
WebDAV is an extension to the HTTP protocol. WebDAV can be used to write on internet using the HTTP protocol.

## Checks
- Look for dangerous HTTP dangerous method like
	- PUT
	- COPY
	- MOVE

## What can be done
- Upload files with executable extensions (maybe it's not forbidden).
- Upload files without executable extensions (like .txt) and try to rename the file (move) with an executable extension.
- Upload files without executable extensions (like .txt) and try to copy the file (move) with executable extension.

## Automate the process
- davtest -url http://10.10.10.10
- cadaver 10.10.10.10


## Manualy exploit
Normally, we can upload a php or asp file, but in this case the web application was disallowing those extension:

To bypass this behavior, it is possible (if activated), to use the “MOVE” method:
