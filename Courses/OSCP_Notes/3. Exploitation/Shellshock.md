# Shellshock
Bash is not usually available through a web application but can be indirectly exposed through a Common Gateway Interface "CGI".
To exploit "Shellshock", we need to find a way to "talk" to Bash. This implies finding a CGI that will use Bash. 
CGI scripts can be written in:
- Python
- Perl
- Shell
- C

## Checks
- Look a folder called /cgi-bin/
- Look for CGI scripts in general inside the web application
