# Assembly Language
## 1) High-level vs. Low-level
In the past, applications had to be written in assembly for each processor, so it was not easy to develop an application for multiple processors.
In the early 1970's, high-level languages (like `C`) were developed to make it possible to write a single easy to understand code that can work on any processor.
To be more specific, this was made possible by creating compilers for each language.

Later on, interpreted languages were developed, like `Python`, `PHP`, `Bash`, `JavaScript`, and others, which are usually not compiled but are interpreted during run time.
These libraries are typically written and compiled in other high-level languages like `C` or `C++`. So when we issue a command in an interpreted language, it would use the compiled library to run that command.

## 2) Example
#### Python code
```python
print("Hello World!")
```

#### C code
```c
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
    write(1, "Hello World!", 12);
    _exit(0);
}
```

#### Assembly
```asm
mov rax, 1
mov rdi, 1
mov rsi, message
mov rdx, 12
syscall

mov rax, 60
mov rdi, 0
syscall
```
