# Data movement
 The main `Data Movement` instructions are:

 ## MOV instruction
 We can load immediate data using the `mov` instruction. For example, we can load the value of `1` into the `rax` register using the `mov rax, 1` instruction.
 Note: In assembly, moving data does not affect the source operand. So, we can consider `mov` as a `copy` function, rather than an actual move.
```bash
yuwie@htb[/htb]$ nasm -f elf64 fib.s && objdump -M intel -d fib.o
...SNIP...
0000000000000000 <_start>:
   0:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    eax,0x0
   5:	bb 01 00 00 00       	mov    ebx,0x1
   a:	b3 01                	mov    bl,0x1
```
 We have to remember here that `the size of the loaded data depends on the size of the destination register`. For example, in the above `mov rax, 1` instruction, since we used the 64-bit register `rax`, it will be moving a 64-bit representation of the number `1` (i.e. `0x00000001`), which is not very efficient.
 
 ## Address Pointers
 Another critical concept to understand is using pointers. In many cases, we would see that the register or address we are using does not immediately contain the final value but contains another address that points to the final value.

 We see that both registers contain pointer addresses to other locations. `GEF` does an excellent job of showing us the final destination value.
 
 #### Moving Pointer Values
We can see that the `rsp` register holds the final value of `0x1`, and its immediate value is a pointer address to `0x1`. So, if we were to use `mov rax, rsp`, we won't be moving the value `0x1` to `rax`, but we will be moving the pointer address `0x00007fffffffe490` to `rax`.

We can use square brackets to compute an address offset relative to a register or another address. For example, we can do `mov rax, [rsp+10]` to move the value stored 10 address away from `rsp`.

```s
# For rsp == 0x00007fffffffdcf0
# For *rsp == 0x1
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, rsp 	# rax == 0x00007fffffffdcf0
    mov rax, [rsp]	# rax == 0x1
```

#### Loading Value Pointers
We need to understand how to load a pointer address to a value, using the `lea` (or `Load Effective Address`) instruction, which loads a pointer to the specified value, as in `lea rax, [rsp]`.
Note that if we use `mov rax, [rsp+10]`, it will actually move the value at `[rsp+10]` to `rax`, as discussed earlier. We cannot move a pointer with an offset using `mov`.
```asm
# For rsp == 0x00007fffffffdcf0
# For *rsp == 0x1
global  _start

section .text
_start:
    lea rax, [rsp+10]	# rsp + 10 == 0x00007fffffffdcfa
    mov rax, [rsp+10]	# rsp + 10 == 0x000000007fffffff
```
