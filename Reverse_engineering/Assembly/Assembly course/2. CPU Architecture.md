# CPU Architecture
## 1) Introduction
The manner in which and how efficiently a CPU processes its instructions depends on its `Instruction Set Architecture` (ISA)
- `RISC` architecture is based on processing more simple instructions, which takes more cycles, but each cycle is shorter and takes less power.
- `CISC` architecture is based on fewer, more complex instructions, which can finish the requested instructions in fewer cycles, but each instruction takes more time and power to be processed.

## 2) Clock speed & clock cycle
Each CPU has a clock speed that indicates its overall speed. Every tick of the clock runs a clock cycle that processes a basic instruction, such as fetching an address or storing an address. Specifically, this is done by the CU or AU.

The frequency in which the cycles occur is counted is cycles per second (`Hertz`). If a CPU has a speed of 3.0 GHz, it can run 3 billion cycles every second (per core).
Modern processors have a multi-core design, allowing them to have multiple cycles at the same time.

## 3) Instruction cycle
An `Instruction Cycle` is the cycle it takes the CPU to process a single machine instruction.

An instruction cycle consists of four stages: `Fetch`, `Decode`, `Execute`, and `Store`:

All of the stages in the instruction cycle are carried out by the Control Unit, except when arithmetic instructions need to be executed "add, sub, ..etc", which are executed by the ALU.

## 4) Example
For example, if we were to execute the assembly instruction `add rax, 1`, it would run through an instruction cycle:
1.  Fetch the instruction from the `rip` register, `48 83 C0 01` (in binary).
2.  Decode '`48 83 C0 01`' to know it needs to perform an `add` of `1` to the value at `rax`.
3.  Get the current value at `rax` (by `CU`), add `1` to it (by the `ALU`).
4.  Store the new value back to `rax`.

Modern computer allow multi-threading. Thus allowing the execution of multiple instruction in parallel.
