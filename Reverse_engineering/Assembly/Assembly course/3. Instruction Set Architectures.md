# Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)
An `Instruction Set Architecture` (`ISA`) specifies the syntax and semantics of the assembly language on each architecture.
It is not just a different syntax.

`ISA` mainly consists of the following components:
-   Instructions
-   Registers
-   Memory Addresses
-   Data Types

There are two main Instruction Set Architectures that are widely used:
-  `Complex Instruction Set Computer` (`CISC`) - Used in `Intel` and `AMD` processors in most computers and servers.
-  `Reduced Instruction Set Computer` (`RISC`) - Used in `ARM` and `Apple` processors, in most smartphones, and some modern laptops.

## CISC
The CISC architecture was one of the earliest ISA's ever developed.
The CISC architecture favors more complex instructions. This is done to rely as much as possible on the CPU by combining minor instructions into more complex instructions.

For example, suppose we were to add two registers with the '`add rax, rbx`' instruction. In that case, a CISC processor can do this in a single 'Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store' instruction cycle.

Two main reasons drove this:
1.  To enable more instructions to be executed at once by designing the processor to run more advanced instructions in its core.
2.  In the past, memory and transistors were limited, so it was preferred to write shorter programs by combining multiple instructions into one.

## RISC
The RISC architecture favors splitting instructions into minor instructions, and so the CPU is designed only to handle simple instructions.
For example, the  `add r1, r2, r3` instruction on a RISC processor would fetch `r2`, then fetch `r3`, add them, and finally store them in `r1`. Every instruction of these takes an entire 'Fetch-Decode-Execute-Store' instruction cycle, which leads, as can be expected, to a larger number of total instructions per program, and hence a longer assembly code.
