# Computer architecture
## 1) History
- Modern computer are build on the `Von Neumann Architecture`
	- Concept developed in 1945
	- Based on Alan Turing idea
	- Based on Charles Babbage's 
		- All of them were mathematicians

## 2) Architecture : High overview

Furthermore, the CPU itself consists of three main components:
-   Control Unit (CU)
-   Arithmetic/Logic Unit (ALU)
-   Registers

## 3) Memory
There are two main types of memory:
1.  Cache
2. Random Access Memory (RAM)

#### 3.1) Cache memory
Cache memory is usually located within the CPU itself and hence is extremely fast compared to RAM, as it runs at the same clock speed as the CPU. However, it is very limited in size and very sophisticated, and expensive to manufacture due to it being so close to the CPU core.
This is the main benefit of cache memory. It enables the CPU to access the upcoming instructions and data quicker than retrieving them from RAM.

#### 3.2) RAM
When a program is run, all of its data and instructions are moved from the storage unit to the RAM to be accessed when needed by the CPU.
As we can see, the RAM is split into four main `segments`:

Although this segmentation applies to the entire RAM, `each application is allocated its Virtual Memory when it is run`. This means that each application would have its own `stack`, `heap`, `data`, and `text` segments.

## 3.3) Sum up

## 4) IO/Storage
we have the Input/Output devices, like the keyboard, the screen, or the long-term storage unit, also known as Secondary Memory.
The processor can access and control IO devices using `Bus Interfaces`
Each Bus has a capacity of bits (or electrical charges) it can carry simultaneously. This usually is a multiple of 4-bits, ranging up to 128-bits. Bus interfaces are also usually used to access memory and other components outside the CPU itself.
