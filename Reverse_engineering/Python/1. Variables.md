## A Few Simple Variables

```python
advice = "Don't panic"
ultimate_answer = 42
potential_question = 6 * 7
confident = True
something_false = False
problems = None
# Oh, and by the way, this is a comment. We can tell by the leading # sign.
```

### Strings
The first variable, `advice`, is a `string`. Strings in Python can be specified using both `"double quotes"` and `'single quotes'`.

### Integers
Following the `advice` variable comes two numbers, or `integers`, the first of which is a number. The second variable, `potential_question`, is also a number but not until `runtime`. During runtime, the equation `6 * 7` is evaluated to `42`, which is then stored as the variable.

### Booleans
Following the number variables come two `boolean` variables, `confident` and `something_false`. A boolean value is a truth value and can be either `True` or `False`.

### Note about the 'None' value
`None` is a special "nothingness" of a value similar to `null` in other languages.
It allows
- to `define variables` in the code but not give them a concrete value
- to create a more meaningful program flow
- to return it as a value if "none of something" was found.
- to enhance the program flow and readability
