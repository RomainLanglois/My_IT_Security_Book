# List / Dictionary / Tuples
#### List
List are just like arrays.
 A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects.
 Lists are mutable.
 
 ```python
 # Creating a List with
# the use of multiple values
List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
print("List containing multiple values: ")
print(List[0]) 
print(List[2])
 ```

```bash
List containing multiple values: 
Geeks
Geeks
```

#### Dictionary
Dictionary holds key:value pair
Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
```python
# Creating a Dictionary 
# with Integer Keys
Dict = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
print("Dictionary with the use of Integer Keys: ")
print(Dict)
```

```bash
Dictionary with the use of Integer Keys: 
{1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
```

#### Tuples
A tuple looks like a list but can't be modify (It is not mutable)
```python
>>> a = (3, 4, 7)
>>> type(a)
<class 'tuple'>
```
