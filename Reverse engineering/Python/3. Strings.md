# Strings
#### Format Strings
```python
equation = f'The meaning of life might be {6 * 7}.'  # -> The meaning of life might be 42.

me = 'Birb'
greeting = f'Hello {me}!'  # -> Hello Birb!
```

#### Raw Strings
One new addition to the mix is the `r'...'` string. This is a raw string
Normally a `\` is used as an `escape-character`
Here `r'\w+'` is telling Python to interpret the `\w` part of the string as two individual characters and not an escaped `w`

```bash
romain@R9TRN4F  ~/Téléchargements  cat raw.py 
# Non interpreted string
print(r'\r')
# Interpreted string
print('\r')

 romain@R9TRN4F  ~/Téléchargements  python3 raw.py 
\r
	# The \r was interpreted 
```

#### Strings Indexing

#### Substrings
```python
>>> var = "ABCDEF"
>>> print(var[:2])	# Up to index 2
AB
>>> print(var[2:])	# Ignore everything up to index 2
CDEF
>>> print(var[2:4])	# Everything between index 2 and 4 ("2" is counted)
CD
>>> print(var[-2:])	# Up to negative index 2 (last two characters)
EF
